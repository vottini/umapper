**umapper** contains auxiliary methods to allow some kinds of mappings.
Specificaly, it has methods to translate the case style (snake, camel, pascal) of
dictionaries to and from each other. It also includes facilities to turn multiple-layered
dictionaries into objects, and last but not least, to combine dictionaries recursively.
